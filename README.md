(in progress) Senior thesis in mathematics

Part of mathematics major at Pomona College

Topic: Algorithms and Artificial Intelligence for 2048

22nd February, 2018: Currently working on extending Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithms and implementing reinforcement learning.

To run code:

Run first cell (game mechanics) 
Run second cell (efficient game move implementation)
Run cell with different AI (starting with randomise)
Run main() 

(AI parameters can be edited)

AI 13 (Limited depth Monte Carlo evaluation) is the most successful player so far.
